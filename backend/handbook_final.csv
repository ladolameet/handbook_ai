different functional areas. In the final trimester, students undertake a Capstone Project, 
which helps students create confidence and empower students to face “real world” 
challenges.  
The academic year 2025 -27 begins in August 2025 (as per AICTE notification) and ends 
in May 202 7. The students are also required to complete an internship at the end "
6,"of the 
first year. If a student does not complete the minimum requirements for the award of a 
degree at the end of the programme, s/he can take two more years  (i.e., a maximum of 
2+2=4 years in total), to complete the programme, subject to fulfilment  of conditions 
stated later in this handbook. The PGDM programme offers core courses and elective 
courses. All core cours es are compulsory, and it is mandatory to pass these courses to 
be eligible for a degree. The list of 1st year courses o"
6,"ffered to the students of PGDM

handle varied and complex business problems successfully.  
7. Projects  
7.1 Group Projects – A Chance for Growing Together  
Working with talented and accomplished peers provides a unique opportunity for 
accelerated professional and personal growth. Group projects are a major component 
of most courses, and help students develop and refine their skills in working with 
diverse gro ups. The grou"
7,"ps are formed from pools of varied disciplines, backgrounds, 
corporate experience, and career orientations to leverage the enormous diversity in 
perspectives.  
7.2 Capstone Project  
In the sixth trimester, students will undergo a Capstone Project. The Capstone Project 
places students in the driving seat to solve real -world business problems. Students will 
learn to face challenging and integrative problems of the real business world that 
require a techno -managerial perspective and are gl"
7,"obal.  
8. Student Feedback  
The students will be requested to provide their feedback twice in a term about the 
courses they have attended.  The Program Office will circulate a Feedback 
Questionnaire to each student, which s/he is expected to complete and submit to the 
concerned official within the given session. When taken online, the students are 
allowed to fill in the feedback within a certa in pre -stipulated time interval on the 
corresponding portal. This feedback helps in further imp"
7,"roving the quality of the 
courses that are deliver ed to the students.  
9. Examinations  
1) Occupy the seat allotted to you in the seating chart. Every Student should be 
seated in the exam hall 10 minutes before the scheduled commencement of the 
paper. Entry into the examination hall after the commencement of the paper will 
be solely at the discretion of the examination coordinator, but in no case will the 
student be allowed to enter after the first half an hour of the exam.  
2) Each stu"
7,"dent must always wear his/her identity card and produce whenever 
asked. A student who is not displaying an identity card may not be allowed to

8,"referred to.  
8) Each student must bring his/her calculator and no borrowing or lending of 
calculators will be permitted during the exam. Students are not allowed to keep 
any books, paper, scientific calculators, mobile phones, smart watches, iPads, or 
any Bluetooth device  in the examination hall.  
9) Verbal or non -verbal conversation with other students is prohibited.  
10) Passing, receiving, or seeing answer papers of other students during 
examinations is strictly prohibited. Anyone w"
8,"ho willfully assists will be

looking at other students’ answer books will be deemed to be an attempt at 
copying.  
11) The students must ensure that the main answer book  and that each answer 
sheet  is signed by the supervisor.  
12) All Examinations are conducted under CCTV camera and later if found that any 
one or more student(s) was copying then appropriate action will be taken.  
13) At the end of the examina"
8,"tion, the supervisor on duty would collect the answer 
books from the desk, and therefore students should stay back until their answer 
books are collected. However, those who finish the examination at least fifteen 
minutes before th e closing time could leave the hall earlier after handing in the 
answer books to the supervisor. No student will be allowed to leave the exam 
hall within the first half hour of the commencement of exams and in the last

Page | 6 15) Penalties for the breach of examination rules and regulations may result in a 
maximum punishment of expulsion from the Programme. The punishment will be 
determined by the appropriate authority through due process.  
10. Evaluation System  
10.1 Evaluations  
AIDTM follows a continuous evaluation system that is fair and rigorous. Each course 
will have a few evaluation components which may include mid -term examination, end-
term  examination, case discussions, class participat"
9,"ion, assignments, projects, quizzes, 
class tests , and/or any other method. The concerned faculty will pre -announce the 
components and scheme of evaluation in the course outline.  
10.2 Eligibility  for Writing  End-Term  Examination  
The Institute expects students to attend all classes. A minimum of 70% attendance  is 
required by the student to be eligible to appear for the end -term examination.  
The Institute  reserves the right to allow a student with lower attendance to appear for 
th"
9,"e end -term examination.  Refer to Annexure III  for the attendance policy of the 
institute.  
Grade  A B C D F I 
Description  Excellent  Good  Satisfactory  Low 
Pass  Fail Incomplete  
(Final Grade 
Pending)  
10.3 Grading System  
A five -point scale will be used for evaluating students in individual courses.  
For each component of evaluation, generally, marks are first awarded which are next 
converted into letter grades with the instructor deciding the range of marks for each 
letter gra"
9,"de. The component -wise letter grades are then converted into numerical 
value s (up to two decimal points) by using the Grade Conversion Table.  
The values, so obtained by a student in various components of evaluation in a course, 
would be added and the sum would be divided by 3 to obtain the final course grade 
points which will then be converted into a final letter grade for the entire course by 
using the following conversion table:  
Grade Point  3.55 to 4.33  2.55 to 3.54  1.55 to 2.54  "
9,"0.55 to 1.54  0.00 to 0.54  
Grade  A B C D F 
 "
10," 
 
Page | 7 ‘I’ grade is awarded in extraordinary situations . Refer to the subsection on the ‘I’ grade.  
10.3.1 ‘I’ Grade  
If a student has not fulfilled the academic requirements of a course, he/she may be 
assigned an “I” (Incomplete) grade temporarily, representing non -completion of the 
academic requirements of the course. First -year PGDM students must complete any 
such incomplete coursework  before they proceed for their summer internship. In the 
case of a second -year student, such"
10," incomplete coursework  of a particular academic 
term should be completed within the following term. The “I” grade obtained in the sixth 
term must be completed well in time to graduate. If for any reason, the student fails to 
complete the course within the time stipulated by the course instructor and/or the 
Program  Office, then the “I” grade will be automatically converted into an “F” grade.  
If a student misses one or more components of the evaluation with prior permission, 
the following"
10," procedure will be followed:  
I. Initially, the student will be awarded an “I” (incomplete) grade. “I” is a temporary  
grade, not intended to be shown as a final grade in a course.  
II. When the student completes the make -up requirements as specified by the 
course instructor within the specified time, “I” will be replaced by the final grade 
(A, B, C, D, F) awarded for that component by the instructor.  
III. In case the student fails to complete the make -up requirements as indicated  in 
"
10,"(Point  # II) above, the instructor will give an “F” for the missed component(s) of 
evaluation.  
IV. The grades given by an instructor in any component of the evaluation are final. 
The instructor will not be called upon to justify the grades if they conform to the 
norms. A student who desires clarification on the grade(s) awarded, may discuss 
the matter with the concerned instructor(s) within 4 days after receiv ing the 
grades. If any grievance regarding grading is not resolved through dis"
10,"cussion 
with the instructor or if the instructor is not available in the station, the 
concerned student may refer the ma tter to the  Dean  in writing within 2 days 
thereafter, who will then discuss the matter with the instructor, if required.  
V. In the case of the Term -III end -term examination, the students may ask queries 
through email. The faculty members are expected to respond as deemed 
necessary.  "
11," 
 
Page | 8 10.4 Grade Point Average (GPA)  
GPA for a term is the weighted average of the grade points obtained in the courses 
registered for by a student in that term, the weights being the respective course credits.  
The trimester grade point average of a student shall be calculated based on the number 
of credits (Ci) assigned to any course (i) of the trimester and the grade point (Pi) earned 
in the course.  
GPA:  𝑆𝑢𝑚∑𝐶𝑖𝑃𝑖𝑛
𝑖=1 
∑𝐶𝑖𝑛
𝑖=1 
10.5 Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA)  
CGP"
11,"A, as at the end of a term/year, is the weighted average of the grade points obtained 
in all the courses registered by a student up to the end including that term/year, the 
weights being the respective course credits.  Where Ci is the total no. of credits assigned 
to any trimester (ith) and Gi is the GPA obtained in that trimester (ith). 
CGPA:  𝑆𝑢𝑚∑𝐶𝑖𝐺𝑖𝑛
𝑖=1 
∑𝐶𝑖𝑛
𝑖=1 
Refer to Annexure - IV for the System of Evaluation  of the Institute .  
10.6 Communication of Grades  
• Course instructor"
11,"s are required to communicate to the students the marks 
obtained in the quizzes/exams as soon as possible. Instructors may 
communicate the component -wise marks directly to students, while the final 
course grade is communicated to the stude nts by the Program Office.  
• The Program Office will communicate to students their final letter grades in 
various courses along with GPA and CGPA.  
10.7 Grade Dispute  
A student who  has a dispute with the grade announced in any component of the 
eval"
11,"uation or the overall grade has recourse available as per the norms and procedure 
prescribed by the Institute. Refer to Annexure V  for the grade revision appeal process.  "
12," 
 
Page | 9 11. Criteria for Award of PGDM  
A second -year student, who has satisfactorily completed the capstone  project, will 
qualify for the award of the Diploma if he/she satisfies the following criteria:  
a) He/she should have a CGPA of at least 2. 17 at the end of the second year.  
b) He/she should not have an “F” or “I” in any course of the programme.  
c) A student should not have any outstanding dues to the institute.  
A student who  does not satisfy the criteria  mentioned above"
12," will be asked to withdraw 
from the programme.  
A student must complete the academic requirement for the award of a diploma in a 
period not more than course duration+2 years.  
12. Academic Misconduct  
The institute attaches utmost importance to strict integrity and honesty in all segments 
of academic work. Any form of dishonesty,  including an attempt to copy or help others 
copy in any manner is strictly prohibited. Unless specified otherwise by the instructor, 
students must not collabor"
12,"ate/syndicate in any manner in the completion of home 
assignments and projects. All sources of information and ideas used for the completion 
of the assignments and projects must be explicitly acknowledged. In other words, the 
non-referenced part of the answer as presented to the instructor should be the 
independent work of the student/s.  
12.1 Unfair Means in Exams  
AIDTM has a zero -tolerance policy towards academic and non -academic misconduct. 
One of the academic misconducts is cheatin"
12,"g in the examination. The procedure for 
handling cheating cases is described below:  
If a student is found cheating or attempting to cheat, the invigilator must  take on -the-
spot action as follows:  
I. If the attempt is minor  the concerned invigilator can take spot action like giving a 
warning, changing the seat, marking the answer paper with a deduction of some 
points (if a concerned faculty member is the invigilator) or anything else that is 
considered appropriate in that situation.  "
12,"
II. If the attempt is not minor , then,  
o The invigilator who has malpractice should take the concerned student 
out of the exam hall, take him to another room and take the student’s 
statement in writing.  "
13," 
 
Page | 10 o Collect the answer paper written so far by the student and keep it 
together with the statement of the student.  
o Send the student back to the exam hall, give another answer paper and 
ask the student to continue from where  left off. 
o The student will not be entitled to any extra time to compensate for the 
loss of time during this exercise.  
o On completion of the examination, the concerned invigilator should give 
his statement about how the student was caught. This invig"
13,"ilator’s 
statement along with the student’s statement and both answer papers 
must be submitted to the Program  Office  for further action.  
III. The Programme Chair will then refer the matter to the Disciplinary Committee for 
appropriate action. From this point “Consequences of Misconduct’ rules and 
procedures  will be applicable with a window for redressal by the aggrieved party.  
12.2 Plagiarism  
Plagiarism is professionally unethical. AIDTM expects students to demonstrate a high 
level"
13," of understanding about plagiarism and avoid being party to plagiarism. (Refer to 
Annexure VI  for guidelines to avoid plagiarism)  
• Stealing the words  and ideas of someone else, without any acknowledgement  
is an  example of plagiarism. In any take -home assignment and project as well 
as in any open book examination one must not plagiarise.  
• The concerned faculty may impose severe penalties  if any student has indulged 
in plagiarism activity.  
• If the plagiarism case is referred to "
13,"the Institute Disciplinary Committee for 
appropriate action, then the action may vary from zero in the component to 
expulsion from the programme. The decision of the Institute Disciplinary 
Committee will be final and binding to all.  
• However, a student may file a mercy petition to the Dean , who will decide on a 
case -to-case  basis whether to grant mercy or not.  
12.3 Mobile Phone  
• The use  of mobile phones  in and around classrooms is strictly prohibited. Use of 
a camera in a mobil"
13,"e anywhere on campus for any undesired purpose is strictly 
prohibited.  
• Keep the mobile phone switched off / silent during the class.  
• Anyone who violates  these rules may be charged a spot fine of Rs. 500.  "
14," 
 
Page | 11 • Refer to Annexure VII  for the Mobile Phone Policy of the Institute and abide by 
the same.  
12.4 Other Norms of Conduct  
• Canvassing for grades is strictly prohibited.  
• Marking proxy attendance for others or having attendance marked by others will 
attract severe punishments.  
• Cases of indiscipline or misconduct such as mass abstention from classes, 
irresponsible behaviour inside or outside the classes, use of unethical practices 
during the summer internship/placement"
14,"  or violation of the rules and 
regulations of the programme will be severely dealt with.  
• The case method of instruction depends upon the confidence of businesses 
from which data are collected. Case names and data are frequently disguised. 
Students should ensure that the confidentiality of the data obtained for 
educational purposes is not viola ted in any way.  
• It is expected that for the group assignments group members contribute equally 
to complete the assignment. All the members o"
14,"f the group should actively 
participate in the group assignment. Appropriate actions will be taken if the 
faculty observes that all the group members are not participating equally in the 
group projects.  
• It is expected that the students will come  prepared for the class with a reading 
of prescribed material, preparation of cases, etc.  
13. Non-Academic Misconduct  
The Institute attaches utmost importance to professional behaviour from all students 
in and outside the class. Misconduct o"
14,"f a non -academic nature is also taken very 
seriously in our Institute. Serious  misconduct may lead to expulsion from the Institute.  
13.1 Ragging on Campus

Page | 23 Annexure V I: Guidelines to Avoid Plagiarism  
The purpose of these guidelines is to appraise the students to make them aware of 
academic integrity, plagiarism & its consequences and referencing style in assignments, 
project reports or independent study submissions. For detailed understanding, students  
are encouraged to refer to the suggested referencing style given in this note.  
Note that at AIDTM, we expect our students to demonstrate utmost academic integrity 
and understa"
26,"nd the consequences if we do not.  
What is Academic Integrity?  
Academic Integrity is an honest and responsible scholarship. As a student, you are 
expected to submit original work and give credit to other people's ideas. Maintaining 
your academic integrity involves:  
• Creating and expressing your ideas in coursework.  
• Acknowledging all sources of information.  
• Completing assignments independently or acknowledging collaboration.  
• Accurately reporting results when conducting your re"
26,"search, experiment, or 
concerning  labs.  
• Honesty during examinations.  
Academic integrity is the foundation of institutional success. Learning how to express 
original ideas, cite sources, work independently, and report results accurately and 
honestly are skills that carry students beyond their academic careers . Academic 
dishonesty not only cheats the student of valuable learning experiences, but can result 
in a failing grade on assignments, a failing grade in a course, or even expulsi"
26,"on from the 
institute.  
Plagiarism  
Plagiarism (from the Latin plagiarius, an abductor, and plagiare, to steal) is defined as 
“… the appropriation of another person’s ideas, processes, results or words without 
giving appropriate credit.”  
At AIDTM, we recognize that the open exchange of ideas plays a vital role in academic  
endeavour, as often it is only through discussion with others that one is fully able to 
process information or to crystallize an elusive concept. Therefore, students "
26,"generally 
are encouraged to engage in conversations with their teachers and classmates ab out 
their courses, their interests, and even their assignments. These kinds of discussions 
and debates in some ways represent the essence of life in an academic community like "
27," 
 
Page | 24 ours. And yet, all students need to acknowledge  clearly when they have relied upon or 
incorporated the work of others. To ensure the proper use of sources while at the same 
time recognizing and preserving the importance of the academic dialogue, we have 
adopted the following policy:  
“It is expected that all homework assignments, projects, reports, papers, theses, and 
examinations and any other work submitted for academic credit will be the student’s 
own. Students should alw"
27,"ays take great care to distinguish their ideas and knowledge 
from information derived from sources. The term “sources” includes not only primary 
and secondary material published in print or online, but also information and opinions 
gained directly from other people. No student shall claim or submit the academic work 
of another as one’s own. Students who, for whatever reason, submit work either not 
their own or  without clear attribution to its sources will be subject to disciplinary action,"
27," 
up to and  including a requirement to withdraw from the Institute.”  
Plagiarism may be accidental or blatant and there is even self -plagiarism. However, 
students are held to the same standards whether  they knew they were plagiarizing or 
whether  they were plagiarizing themselves or someone else.  
Accidental or Unintentional  
One may not even know that they are plagiarizing. It is the student's responsibility to 
make certain that they understand the difference between quoting and paraph"
27,"rasing, 
as well as the proper way to cite material.  
Blatant  
Here, students understand they are plagiarizing. Purposefully using someone else's 
ideas or work without proper acknowledgement  is plagiarism. This includes turning in 
borrowed or bought research papers as one's own.  
Self 
Turning in the same term paper (or substantially the same paper) for two courses 
without getting permission from one's instructor is plagiarism.  
Unless authorized by their instructors, students are expect"
27,"ed to do their own, original 
work on each assignment in each class. A student who recycles his or her coursework  
from one class to another may face an allegation of academic dishonesty.  
An instructor who believes a student has committed an act of plagiarism should take 
appropriate action,  which includes the issuing of a “penalty grade”, defined as “a grade "
28," 
 
Page | 25 assigned to a student by a faculty member based on a charge of academic misconduct”. 
A penalty grade can include but is not limited to, a failing grade on the assignment or 
in the course.  
What constitutes plagiarism or cheating?  
This might occur in an assignment when:  
• copying word -for-word directly from a text  
• paraphrasing the words from a text very closely  
• using text downloaded from the internet  
• borrowing statistics or assembled facts from another person or "
28,"source without 
acknowledging  
• copying or downloading figures, photographs, pictures or diagrams without 
acknowledging sources  
• copying from the notes or essays of a fellow student  
• copying from your notes, a text, tutorial, video or lecture, that contains direct 
quotations.  
Referencing styles  
A referencing style is a set of rules telling you how to acknowledge the thoughts, ideas 
and works of others in a particular way. Referencing is a crucial part of successful 
academic  writ"
28,"ing and is key to your assignments and research. At AIDTM, it is 
encouraged that the students follow the APA referencing style, details of which are as 
follows:  
APA (American Psychological Association)  
The American Psychological Association publishes a style guide, the Publication 
Manual of the American Psychological Association, which is commonly used by writers, 
editors and students in social science subjects. The APA also provides a free basic 
online tutorial for using the APA Style "
28,"which includes guidance on how to reference.  
APA Links  
The following, freely available APA web guides may also help you to reference your work 
using the APA style:

Plagiarism Check  
There are some paid as well as free plagiarism check software available. The students 
are advised to use one of them before turning in  any assignment or project. The free 
online plagiarism check can be done at any of the following websites (there are more):

Page | 27 Annexure V II: Mobile Phone Policy  
Mobile phones  are a useful gadget and their  use in the right places cannot be denied. 
However, to facilitate  healthy academic processes, we adopt the following policy 
regulations regarding the use of mobile phones on campus:  
During the class , all students must keep their phones in switch -off or silent mode.  
If a mobile phone rings during the class, or if a student is found using a mobile phone 
in the class, the phone may be confiscat"
30,"ed immediately by the faculty member, who will 
deposit the phone in the Program Office.  
In the examination hall, all the students must switch off  their mobile phones and keep 
them on the main table of the examination hall. Keeping a switched -off mobile in the 
pocket is also not permissible during the examination.  If the mobile is found with any 
student during the examination, it will be confiscated and deposited in the program  
office.  
The confiscated mobile can be returned to the co"
30,"ncerned student only after  a fine of 
Rs. 2000/ - (1st Time), and Rs. 5000/ - (2nd Time) is paid by the student. Thereafter, if 
a student is found with a mobile phone, it will be finally confiscated. This is without 
prejudice to the Institute’s right to take suitable action against the student for breach 
of academic discipline.  
The Institute has the right  to look up the data on the mobile, especially when the mobile 
phone is confiscated during examination, and if any objectionable materi"
30,"al is found 
then appropriate steps will be initiated for academic malpractice.  
The mobile of a student who  has violated this policy a third time  will be confiscated,  
and further appropriate actions will be taken by the disciplinary committee of the 
Institute.

Page | 28 Annexure VI II: Anti -Ragging Rules and Regulations  
The higher education community is aware that ragging in higher education institutions 
is a great concern for all authorities including law enforcement agencies. Prevention 
and prohibition of ragging on campus are very important. In this context, the Report  
submitted by the Raghavan Committee constituted by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in 
SLP No.24295/2006 is relevant. Hon’ble Supreme Court of India accepted the various 
recomm"
31,"endations made by the Raghavan Committee and made it mandatory for the 
concerned to im plement the following recommendations.  
The punishment to be meted out must be exemplary and justifiably harsh to act as a 
deterrent against the recurrence of such incidents.  
For every single incident of ragging where the victim or his parent/guardian or the Head 
of Institution is not satisfied with the institutional arrangement for action, a First 
Information Report must be filed without exception by t"
31,"he institutional authorit ies with 
the local police authorities. Any failure on the part of the institutional authority or 
negligence or deliberate delay in lodging the FIR with the local police shall be construed 
to be an act of culpable negligence on the part of the authorities b y the Courts. All 
efforts should be made to ensure that cases involving ragging are taken up on a priority
